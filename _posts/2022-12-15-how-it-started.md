# A slow website Google Analiytics and a Logfile
They say all great ideas start with a pain, or in the case of progarmer just wanting to automate sometthing (why do a job in 5 minuates why you can spend an hour coding?). Let me set the sence it's late 2018 a youger Peter is on a placement. I noticed that my website kept slowing down like a sudden rush of traffic had come to my site, and Google Anaylics confirmed there was traffic, YAY my website has taken off how wrong I was.

Google Anaylics showed that traffic was comming in waves about every 4 hours but for 0 seconds, that was the first sigin of any attack on my site. I had to find a way to stop this.
